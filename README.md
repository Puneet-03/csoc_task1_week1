I made a Hangman Game having 4 main web pages and an extra game which is quite similar to wordle.
First we need to login using our username and set up a password for the same. Thereafter we get options to chose the mode we want to play the game in. The easy mode gives you 6 chances to guess wrong and the words are smaller whereas the hard mode gives only 3 wrong chances and the words are larger.

Happy Guessing :)
